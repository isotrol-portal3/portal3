DEBUG AND PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS

2 profiles are defined, according to user needs:

-profile 'debug' displays the GWT Debug Panel to the top-right corner, and a log panel in the menu.
To activate 'debug' profile, run the Maven build with option '-P debug', for example:
	mvn clean install -P debug 

-profile 'production' displays the app with no debug tweaks.
This profile is active by default, so there's no need to specify it.



CONSTANTS AND i18n INTERFACES GENERATION

The GWT constants and i18n interfaces are generated automatically. To build the project and create 
those interfaces:

	mvn clean generate-resources gwt:i18n package install

or whatever is needed after 'package', instead of 'install'


Otherwise, if there is no need to create the interfaces, this should suffice:
	mvn clean package install


All that jazz is necessary because gwt-maven-plugin bounds the goal i18n to 'package' phase, and we don't need 
auto generation of code in some environments, like Continuous Integration; so that binding is commented out,
and an explicit 'gwt:i18n' must be specified before 'package'.

On the other way, 'Settings.properties' is special: it must be filtered prior to firing 'gwt:i18n', so an
execution of 'resources:copy-resources' was bound to 'generate-resources' phase. That's why it must be invoked 
before 'gwt:i18n'.
